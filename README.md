# NLP Tourism Recommendation Model Repository

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) recommendation model built using TensorFlow. The model has been trained to recommend tourist destinations based on user preferences. The trained model is saved as `model.h5`.

## Overview

The NLP recommendation model within this repository is designed to provide personalized tourist destination recommendations based on user-entered preferences. By analyzing natural language inputs, the model suggests places of interest that align with the user's stated preferences.

## Files

- `model.h5`: This file contains the trained NLP recommendation model saved in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5). You can use this pre-trained model to generate tourist destination recommendations based on user preferences.
- `dataset/`: This directory holds the dataset used to train and validate the model. It may contain various text files, CSVs, or other formats used during the model development process.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
- git clone https://github.com/T-Rec-Tourism-Recommendation/nlp-tourism-recommendation.git
- cd nlp-tourism-recommendation/


2. **Using the Model:**
- Load the `model.h5` file into your TensorFlow environment.
- Preprocess the user-entered preferences according to the model's requirements.
- Utilize the model to generate recommended tourist destinations based on the provided preferences.

## Getting Started

If you intend to enhance the model's capabilities, modify the existing model, or train it using a different dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
- Ensure your dataset is structured and formatted appropriately for tourism-related preferences and destinations.
- Update data preprocessing scripts or notebooks to suit your dataset's requirements.

2. **Model Training:**
- Modify the model architecture or hyperparameters as needed.
- Train the model using your dataset containing user preferences and corresponding tourist destinations.

3. **Evaluation and Testing:**
- Assess the model's performance using validation or test datasets.
- Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results.

4. **Saving the Model:**
- Once satisfied with the model's performance, save it as `model.h5` or any other desired format.
